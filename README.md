## How to play
 1. To play the game you can either use space bar/ left click on mouse/ touch in smartphone. Sonic would jump in this response.
 2. The goal is to score as high as possible without getting hit by Moto-Bug.
## Scoring System :-
  1. Collecting the Ring would give 1 point.
  2. If you hit any Moto-Bug while jumping without getting contact with the ground 10 points will be rewarded. And if this happends again untill Sonic hits the ground but knocking the Bugs then the score would multiply x2 times (i.e. 10, 20, 40).
